# This file can be used to override default
# role values. This is useful for "downstream"
# packaging and opinionated releases.
#
# This file can be left empty to use the latest and greatest versions of all containers.
# Or it can contain the tags (~= versions) of the containers to install if there is a known combination you want.
# In case you really know what you are doing it is also possible to override the container names here.
# every other package/role specific value should sit in `roles/*/defaults/main.yml`.
#
# A notable exception are common templates, on which we use a two-steps approach to allow the
# users to easily override the installed version. Templates need to be special.
#
# When possible, the 'version' value in the CRs should take precedence over the defaults value.
# The authoritative sources are, in decreasing priority order
# 1. spec.version in the CRs (set by users)
# 2. the *_TAG environment veriable (set by HCO)
# 3. the builtin defaults (set by devs/operator)
# 4. the per-role defaults, which is the last-resort value. Use a low-maintenance, usually working,
#    easy to spot value. 'latest' is a good value here - probably the only case where we should use it.
#
# Any version, or default, should not be set more than once in a place in the source tree.
